# DRMacIver's i3 config

This is a very lightly modified i3 config mostly designed to make it behave a bit more like
wmii and generally conform to my prejudices slightly better (e.g. I've changed the movement
commands to make it more vim like).

The scripts for dynamic tagging are shamelessly stolen from [Benjamin Kaiser's
implementation](http://www.blog.kaiserapps.com/2014/02/dynamic-tagging-in-i3.html).
